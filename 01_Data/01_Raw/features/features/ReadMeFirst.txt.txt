Needed npy files comes in here. Npy files are created from tiff files. Code is in folder 00_prework_files.

To see the original files, download 4 Gb files from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Lk6i5aLNmdI8nvvSpYESmCH2DSMXaeK7?usp=sharing

NOTE: use the npys to tiff files with the slope images if I forgot to change the file inside the directory to npy form. The code is in 02_Analysis/01_scripts/ 00_prework_files, it's fast to use.
